How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

By testing all parts of the codeâ€™s functionality, I was able to ensure that each performed the way they were expected to. The techniques I chose to use for the various tests in each milestone were dependent on the purpose each was expected to serve. Some tests were designed to test potential user input to ensure that improper lengths would not create vulnerabilities. These tests are considered to be white box techniques; techniques that test the code through the use of test cases and access to the code itself. 
Equivalence partitioning tests were used for both valid and invalid inputs to be sure the code is capable of handling both. Decision tables were used to test conditions. State transition tests were created to test changes in outputs. Boundary values were used to test limitations like maximum character counts for user input. The intention for these tests is not only to verify that the code produces the expected outcomes, but also to ensure that the code meets the requirements of the client.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Functional and non-functional errors must be considered when testing. Meeting the expectations of the clients means more than just ensuring the software performs at the level a user can see. There are many requirements for a program to succeed that a client may not have the technical understanding to consider. These include things like effective data structures, data storage options, proper security measures, and continued maintenance. Security breaches, and both functional and non-functional errors have been known to bring companies down. Even if a company is able to recover from a devastating issue, it can be extremely costly and the trust in the company may never be fully restored. Additionally, developers of systems that encounter these problems will also be affected by the negative impacts. The response developers have to errors and breaches can make or break their image as well.

How do I approach designing software?

Designing software begins with understanding the requirements of the client.
      * Gathering Functional Requirements
      * Gathering Nonfunctional Requirements
      * Creating Use Case Diagrams
      * Creating Activity Diagrams
      * Implementing Security Measures
      * Understanding System Limitations

Use case diagrams and activity diagrams can be invaluable tools when considering which tests should be conducted. Anticipating the ways in which a program will function and be interacted with helps to direct the need for testing in specific areas of the system. Understanding both the functional and non-functional requirements of the client ensures that they can be fully met and greatly increases the odds of producing a satisfying product for the client.
